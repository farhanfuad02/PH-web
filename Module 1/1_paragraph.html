    <h1>Importance of discipline</h1>
    <p>Discipline is the practice of training oneself to follow rules or a <b>code of behavior</b>, often through self-control and consistency. It plays a vital role in achieving personal and professional goals, as it helps individuals stay focused, manage time <strong>effectively</strong>, and overcome <i>distractions</i>. Whether in academics, work, or daily routines, discipline builds habits that lead to long-term success. It requires commitment and the ability to delay short-term gratification in favor of greater rewards. While it may seem restrictive at times, discipline actually creates freedomâ€”freedom to grow, to succeed, and to live <em>purposefully</em>.</p>
